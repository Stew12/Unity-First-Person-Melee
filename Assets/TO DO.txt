TO DO:

BUGS

make fireball/s disappear when hitting a wall

weird texture glitch on incline

Weapon sprites going through wall

Weapon switching- if change weapon in the middle of an animation it will get stuck there, look into this k ALSO happens with sheathing


BALANCING

Power bar balance- does too much damage at lower power level

make footsteps tempo play faster if moving faster, rather than pitch- 
Likely do this by having custom sped up audio clips that are roughly attributed to each section of the movement guage when boosting

TO DO:

BUGS

make player fireball disappear when hitting a wall

weird texture glitch on incline

Weapon sprites going through wall. Other layering issues such as sprites disappearing behind enemy AOE

Weapon switching- if change weapon in the middle of an animation it will get stuck there, look into this k ALSO happens with sheathing

For sorceress, seems like she will sometimes attack but not shoot a fireball

when making a new object for saved item, it creates it in scene as well it seems. Find a way to stop that or destroy it after.

pressing interact twice quickly on a door will make it swing open fast, then shut again. This is actually a cool hidden tech I'd like to
keep, but stop it from closing again after swinging open fast.

Lighting issues, would at minimum like sprites outside of light to not be visible. Could do a programamtic in range type thing but eh

Blocking can be spammed leading to easy parrying. Likely set a cooldown after releasing a block before can block again.

Treasure chest spawns bigger items such as swords in ground. Find some way to deal with this.

Likely do this by having custom sped up audio clips that are roughly attributed to each section of the movement guage when boosting

TO DO:

BUGS

make player fireball disappear when hitting a wall

weird texture glitch on incline

Weapon sprites going through wall. Other layering issues such as sprites disappearing behind enemy AOE

Weapon switching- if change weapon in the middle of an animation it will get stuck there, look into this k ALSO happens with sheathing

For sorceress, seems like she will sometimes attack but not shoot a fireball

BALANCING

EXTENSIONS

Add in ability to pick up weapons, armour and spells



AUDIO

make footsteps tempo play faster if moving faster, rather than pitch- 
Likely do this by having custom sped up audio clips that are roughly attributed to each section of the movement guage when boosting

Player death


LEVEL

Switch moves/rotates platform

Platform rotates/moves and stops at intervals


NPC

Tabs for different inventory categories

Adding if waiting to update methods in player control

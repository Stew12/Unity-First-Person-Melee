TO DO:

Bonus attacks per enemy

make fireball/s disappear when hitting a wall

Durability repair items

Basic inventory menu

Healing items

weird texture glitch on incline

weapon sheathing + makes run faster

Weapon sprites going through wall

Weapon switching- if change weapon in the middle of an animation it will get stuck there, look into this k ALSO happens with sheathing

make footsteps tempo play faster if moving faster, rather than pitch- 
Likely do this by having custom sped up audio clips that are roughly attributed to each section of the movement guage when boosting

Handle extra dialog boxes and lock camera to NPC when speaking to them.

inventory work - selecting, equipping, etc. 

Tabs for different inventory categories

Adding if waiting to update methods in player control


LONG TERM

new weapons + weapon animations

new enemy types

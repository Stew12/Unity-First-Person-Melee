TO DO:

BUGS

make player fireball disappear when hitting a wall

weird texture glitch on incline

Weapon sprites going through wall. Other layering issues such as sprites disappearing behind enemy AOE

Weapon switching- if change weapon in the middle of an animation it will get stuck there, look into this k ALSO happens with sheathing

when making a new object for saved item, it creates it in scene as well it seems. Find a way to stop that or destroy it after.

pressing interact twice quickly on a door will make it swing open fast, then shut again. This is actually a cool hidden tech I'd like to
keep, but stop it from closing again after swinging open fast.

Lighting issues, 'selective double torch' glitch

Blocking can be spammed leading to easy parrying. Likely set a cooldown after releasing a block before can block again.

Blocking bug: sometimes seems that blocking doesnt seem to happen or one attack will be blocked without block happening, then next non-blocked attack will be treated as blocked.

Treasure chest spawns bigger items such as swords in ground. Find some way to deal with this. Idea: have weapons be rotated on their sides

ART STYLE

UI art style update

BALANCING

EXTENSIONS

AUDIO

make footsteps tempo play faster if moving faster, rather than pitch- 
Likely do this by having custom sped up audio clips that are roughly attributed to each section of the movement guage when boosting

GAMEPLAY

Able to transfer between scenes

Durability repair items

Player death 'animation'

Have the hand of the player on its own be animated, not the the weapon, that way we can add in new weapons by simply making it a child of the hand.
